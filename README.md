Requirements:
numpy
tqdm
pygame

Installing these packages should be as simple as opening command prompt
and typing

pip install [package name]

If you know what it is I recommend using a virtual environment but if you 
don't that's fine this command works anyway. If it doesn't work then ask 
me about it.

Please rename and submit connect4/Connect4Players/YOURTEAMPlayer.py

main.py can be modified for testing purposes. You shouldn't have to 
modify any other files to work with the code and I will not be using
any modifications you make elsewhere although feel free to look around
if you want.
